Debian packaging for BOCHS with IDA support
===

This repository is a fork of the Debian BOCHS packaging scripts.  The original repository can be found here:

	git://git.hadrons.org/git/debian/pkgs/bochs.git

The current master branch is based on the branch 'remotes/origin/experimental' from the above repository.

All changes after commit 2b64412 were designed to support IDA's BOCHS plugin.
