_Description: Configuration file format changed
 Since version 2.0 of Bochs came into Debian, there have been two changes
 in the configuration file format.
 .
 Of course, a good option would be to just take a pristine bochsrc from
 /usr/share/doc/bochs/examples/bochsrc.gz and restart from scratch.
 .
 The required changes are:
 .
 Change of syntax for disk and cdrom. ATA support has been added and you
 have to use the new ata-* directives in bochsrc. See the sample bochsrc
 for an example. (note that the obsolete syntax is supported, for now)
 .
 The launcher script used to replace  #home# and #guest# tags with the
 homedir and the guest parameter. This is now done by Bochs, so you'll have
 to change every #home# and #guest# by $HOME and $GUEST.
