This package's orig file contains a pristine Bochs source tree, with some
binary blobs removed (like the propietary BIOS VGABIOS-elpin-2.40 which is
not free software as per the DFSG).

There's a script to help generating this cleaned tarball:

	$ debian/tarball.sh tarball <upstream-tarball>

or a snapshot from Subversion:

	$ debian/tarball.sh snapshot
